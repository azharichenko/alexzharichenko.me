I'm starting up a podcast with my close friend Stephen Hoover to discuss interesting ideas and research papers. Stephen Hoover is a Ph.D. student and Brain Institute Fellow at Florida Atlantic University (FAU). He is a member of the both the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Laboratory and Stern's lab at the Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience. His research focuses on producing on provably safe algorithms that achieve goals in a wide range of environments. 

First episode to hopefully come out before the end of January 2021!
