I'm a Software Engineer at Aurora Innovation working on data mining autonomous driving data. I'm currently working towards becoming a data scientist through working on a masters in computer science, concentrating in machine learning, and in my current role at Aurora by working and support analytics work in my team and for the customers of my data mining platform.

I've previously worked as an intern at places such as Aurora Innovation, University of Pittsburgh as an ML research assistant, Uber ATG (now apart of Aurora Innovation), Komodo Analytics (local Pittsburgh Startup) CMU's Software Engineering Institute, and Highmark Health in various positions including data engineering, software engineering, and data science.
